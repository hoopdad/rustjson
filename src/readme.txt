thanks to copilot for generating the basis for the code with these prompts:
1. write a function in the rust prgoramming language to read a JSON file from disk and create an object hierarchy with it.
2. nice, thank you! can you give me an example JSON object using the Person and Address objects described above?
3. write an example for loop in the rust language that is based on the size of a Vec

that's it! then off and running with our customizations that I wrote by hand.
